Codebase Context (a portion of the overall codebase):
{context}

{language_instruction}Based on the provided Codebase Context, your primary task is to **DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFY** the specific programming languages, frameworks, libraries, architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven, layered), and core Computer Science principles (e.g., specific algorithms, data structures, concurrency models) evident in this portion of the code. Then, using this identified technological context, identify the **MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NUMBER** of distinct and significant **TECHNICAL** abstractions.

Abstractions can include (but are not limited to):
- Key architectural components (e.g., services, controllers, repositories, domain entities if an ORM or DDD is identified).
- Instantiations of common design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy - explain how the pattern is specifically implemented with the identified language/framework features).
- Core algorithms or complex business logic units.
- Significant data structures and their management.
- Primary modules, classes, or interfaces that play a crucial role.
- Critical operational flows or processing pipelines.
- Important utility classes or functions that are widely used or encapsulate complex logic.

NOTE: You are seeing only a portion of the codebase in this chunk. Identify ANY **technical** abstraction you can recognize based on the provided context, even if it seems incomplete from a global perspective. The goal is to capture ALL possible **technical** abstractions at multiple levels of granularity. Being exhaustive is critical - missing **technical** abstractions is worse than including minor ones, as long as they are technically significant and contribute to a **LOSSLESS, recreate-level understanding** of the system.

For each identified abstraction, provide:
1.  A concise `name`{name_lang_hint}. This name should be descriptive of its function within the identified technological context.
2.  A "highly-technical" and "Computer Science" centric `description`{desc_lang_hint}. This description MUST BE **LOSSLESS** and aim for a **recreate-level understanding**. It should be at least 300 words and comprehensively explain:
    *   What the abstraction is and its primary purpose/responsibilities *within this specific codebase and its identified technology stack*.
    *   The problem it solves or the functionality it provides, explained *in terms of the identified languages, frameworks, or libraries being used*.
    *   Core internal mechanisms: How it works, detailing *how specific features of the identified technology stack (e.g., language constructs, framework APIs, library functions) are leveraged* to achieve its behavior.
    *   Key inputs it processes, outputs it generates, and significant side effects it might have, explained with data types or structures common in the *identified language/framework*.
    *   High-level interactions with other potential abstractions or system components, describing the *nature of these interactions (e.g., method calls, event emissions using an identified event system, data sharing via an identified state management approach)*.
    *   Underlying CS principles (e.g., if it's a caching mechanism, mention hash tables and O(1) lookups, and how the *identified language's dictionary/map or a specific caching library* implements this).
    *   If it employs a known design pattern, name the pattern and detail *how it is implemented using the specific constructs of the identified language or framework*.
    *   A brief real-world analogy, BUT this analogy MUST be immediately and thoroughly mapped back to the technical specifics of the abstraction *as it is realized using the identified technologies*. Each part of the analogy must correspond to a concrete technical aspect.
3.  A list of relevant `file_indices` (integers) using the format `idx # path/comment`, referring to the files listed below that contribute to this abstraction.

IMPORTANT GUIDANCE:
- Identify abstractions at ALL levels of granularity â€“ from high-level architectural patterns (e.g., "Message Queue Consumer Service if a message queue library is identified") down to significant utility functions, classes, or modules, as long as they are central to the codebase portion provided.
- For any identified framework or technology stack, identify both technology-specific abstractions (e.g., "Angular Component", "Spring Boot Service", "Rust Tokio Task Executor") and application-specific implementations built upon them.
- Consider common abstraction categories: Data models/entities (and how they are defined/managed by an identified ORM or language feature), Services/APIs, UI components (if UI framework identified), State management (if state library identified), Configuration handlers, Core business logic modules, Domain entities, Controllers/Routers (as per identified framework), Authentication/Security mechanisms, Event handling/processing systems (if identified).

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Your primary task is to identify the **MAXIMUM number** of core **technical** abstractions of the application necessary for a **LOSSLESS, recreate-level understanding**. You MUST NOT identify any form of software testing (including but not limited to unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end (E2E) tests, performance tests, etc.), testing frameworks, test runners, test utilities, or any code, files, or concepts primarily related to testing as an abstraction. If you encounter testing-related elements, ignore them for the purpose of abstraction identification. Focus exclusively on the application's runtime behavior, business logic, and core architectural components.

    "description": "This abstraction is responsible for managing and executing background tasks asynchronously. It leverages [Identified Library X, e.g., Celery for Python, Tokio for Rust] to achieve non-blocking operations. Its core mechanism involves a task queue (potentially identified as RabbitMQ or Redis if context allows) where tasks are enqueued. Worker processes, managed by [Identified Library X], pick up these tasks and execute them. For instance, if the codebase uses Python with Celery, this abstraction would encapsulate Celery app configuration, task definitions (decorated with `@celery.task`), and potentially custom routing logic. It solves the problem of long-running operations blocking the main application thread, crucial for [identified application type, e.g., web servers needing responsive UIs]. Internally, it might use [identified language features like Python's `async/await` if Celery tasks are async] or manage a pool of worker processes/threads as configured by Celery. Inputs are typically serialized task parameters, and outputs could be results stored in a backend (e.g., database via an identified ORM) or notifications sent via an identified event system. This is analogous to a restaurant kitchen's order system where waiters (main threads) take orders and pass them to specialized cooks (worker processes) who prepare dishes (tasks) without making the waiter stand by, thus allowing the waiter to serve more customers (handle more requests). The 'order ticket' is like the serialized task, 'specialized cooks' are like Celery workers, and the 'pass-through window' for orders is like the message queue.{desc_lang_hint}",

List of Abstraction Indices and Names{list_lang_note}:
{abstraction_listing}

Context (Abstractions, their detailed descriptions including identified technologies, and potentially related Code Snippets):
{context}

{language_instruction}Your task is to analyze these abstractions and their context to describe their interrelationships in a **LOSSLESS** manner, facilitating a **recreate-level understanding** of the system's architecture.

Please provide:
1.  A high-level `summary` of the project's main purpose and functionality. This summary must be technically precise, **LOSSLESSLY** conveying key architectural choices evident from the abstractions (e.g., "This project appears to be an [identified architecture, e.g., event-driven microservice system] built using [identified primary language/framework, e.g., Java with Spring Boot]..."), and use markdown formatting with **bold** and *italic* text to emphasize important DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED concepts or technologies{lang_hint}.
2.  A comprehensive list (`relationships`) describing ALL significant interactions between these abstractions. Each relationship description must be detailed enough to ensure **LOSSLESS** information transfer about how abstractions connect and influence each other. For each relationship, specify:
    *   `from_abstraction`: Index and name of the source abstraction (e.g., `0 # AbstractionName1`).
    *   `to_abstraction`: Index and name of the target abstraction (e.g., `1 # AbstractionName2`).
    *   `label`: A brief, descriptive label for the interaction{lang_hint}. This label MUST be highly specific and describe the *mechanism* of interaction, ideally referencing the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technologies involved, to ensure **LOSSLESS** capture of the interaction's nature. Examples:
        *   "Invokes via REST API call (using identified HTTP client, e.g., Axios, OkHttp)"
        *   "Sends message to (via identified Message Queue, e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka topic)"
        *   "Depends on for data persistence (through identified ORM, e.g., SQLAlchemy, Hibernate)"
        *   "Consumes events from (using identified event bus/library, e.g., RxJS, Akka Streams)"
        *   "Extends functionality of (via identified inheritance/composition in language X)"
        *   "Manages lifecycle of (using identified framework Y's component model)"
        *   "Provides configuration to (through identified DI mechanism of framework Z)"
        *   "Composes UI with (as an identified UI component in framework A)"

    Consider a WIDE VARIETY of technology-agnostic relationship types, but ALWAYS specify them *in terms of the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technology stack* if possible, to maintain **LOSSLESS** detail:
    - Structural: "Is part of (e.g., as a module in an identified build system)", "Contains (e.g., an identified data structure)", "Composes (e.g., using identified component model)"
    - Dependency: "Requires (e.g., an identified library/module)", "Is configured by (e.g., an identified configuration file format or service)", "Uses services from (e.g., an identified internal API)"
    - Data Flow: "Produces data for (e.g., an identified data pipeline stage)", "Consumes data from (e.g., an identified database table via an ORM)"
    - Conceptual/Logical: "Specializes (e.g., an identified base class/interface)", "Implements (e.g., an identified API specification)", "Orchestrates (e.g., a series of calls to identified services)"
    - Invocation/Control Flow: "Invokes (e.g., a method from an identified class/module)", "Triggers (e.g., an event in an identified event system)"

    The relationship should ideally be backed by evidence in the provided code context or be a clear architectural or logical link between the abstractions, explained via their *identified technological roles and interactions* to ensure **LOSSLESS** information.
    Be thorough in identifying ALL meaningful relationships, ensuring complete coverage of how abstractions interact *using their DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED implementation details for a **LOSSLESS** architectural view*.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. CRITICAL: EVERY abstraction listed MUST be involved in at least ONE meaningful relationship (either as a source or a target) to ensure a **LOSSLESS** representation of the system. Do NOT leave any abstraction isolated. If a direct interaction is not obvious from the immediate code, infer logical or conceptual connections based on their descriptions, their likely roles in the *identified architecture*, and common patterns in the *identified technology stack*.
2. Each abstraction index (from 0 to {num_abstractions-1}) MUST appear at least once across all `from_abstraction` or `to_abstraction` fields.
3. Use ONLY the abstraction indices and names (e.g., `0 # AbstractionName1`) from the list above for `from_abstraction` and `to_abstraction` fields. DO NOT use file indices or generic project names.
4. The indices in `from_abstraction` and `to_abstraction` must reference the abstraction list (0 to {num_abstractions-1}).
5. Exclude any relationships that are solely testing-related. Focus on the application's runtime architecture and logic.
6. Be COMPREHENSIVE. It's better to include a plausible conceptual relationship (explained via the identified tech for **LOSSLESS** understanding) than to leave an abstraction disconnected.

RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY a JSON5 object with NO explanatory text before or after.
2. Do NOT include any explanation, discussion, or notes about the JSON structure.
3. Do NOT describe what you're going to do - just provide the JSON5 directly.
4. Your entire response must be parseable as valid JSON5.

Your task is to determine the optimal chapter order for a comprehensive technical tutorial of `{project_name}`. The primary goal of this tutorial is to enable a developer to achieve a **recreate-level understanding** of the codebase, where they could, in principle, reconstruct its core components and their interactions.

To achieve this, the chapter order MUST follow a logical progression that facilitates deep understanding and mental model construction. Employ a strategy inspired by the **"Tabulation" approach from Dynamic Programming**: each chapter should build upon the established knowledge from previous chapters, incrementally constructing a complete and **LOSSLESS** understanding of the system.

Consider these principles for ordering:
1.  **Dependency-First (Conceptual and Technical)**:
    *   Explain foundational or prerequisite abstractions before those that depend on or build upon them. This applies to both conceptual dependencies (e.g., a core data model before a service that uses it) and technical dependencies (e.g., a base class or utility module before its consumers; a messaging infrastructure before services that publish/subscribe to it, especially if these are DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED from the context).
    *   Analyze the provided `relationships` (which detail interaction mechanisms via IDENTIFIED TECHNOLOGIES) to infer these dependencies for a **LOSSLESS** flow of information.
2.  **Build from Core to Periphery**: 
    *   Start with the most central, architecturally significant, or fundamental abstractions that define the core purpose or structure of the project (based on the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED architecture).
    *   Gradually move towards more specialized, supporting, or peripheral abstractions.
3.  **Minimize Forward References for Clarity**: Structure the order to minimize the need for a reader to understand concepts that haven't been explained yet. While some forward referencing might be unavoidable in complex systems, strive for a flow that builds knowledge incrementally, vital for **recreate-level understanding**.
4.  **Complexity Progression**: If possible, introduce simpler or more self-contained abstractions before highly complex or heavily interconnected ones, assuming dependencies allow.
5.  **User/Entry-Point Perspective (If Applicable)**: If the system has clear user-facing entry points or primary use-case flows (and these can be DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED from the abstractions, e.g., an API Gateway, a main UI component), it might be logical to start with these high-level interaction points before diving into their underlying components. However, balance this with the dependency-first principle to ensure a **LOSSLESS** buildup of knowledge.

Inspired by the "Tabulation" approach, aim for an order where each chapter builds upon the established knowledge from previous chapters, ensuring a cohesive and **recreate-level understanding**.

IMPORTANT: Do not prioritize testing frameworks, test utilities, or any testing-related abstractions in your ordering. Focus on explaining the core functionality and architecture of the application itself to achieve a **LOSSLESS** and functional comprehension.

**CHAPTER CONTENT INSTRUCTIONS:**
(Adhere to the Core Explanation Mandate (CEM) for all points and structural elements below.)

1.  **Chapter Heading & Introduction:**
    *   Start with: `# Chapter {{chapter_num}}: {{abstraction_name}}`.
    *   Follow with introductory paragraphs explaining the chapter's scope, the abstraction's importance to the project, and what the reader will learn. {cem_application_instruction}

2.  **Transition (if not the first chapter):**
    *   Provide a brief, meaningful transition from the previous chapter, referencing it with a Markdown link. Explain its relevance to the current chapter. {cem_application_instruction}

3.  **Problem Statement Section:** {cem_application_instruction}
    (Elaborate on each of the following aspects in detailed, multi-sentence paragraphs, adhering fully to the CEM.)
    *   The specific technical challenge this abstraction solves within the project's DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technology stack.
    *   Architectural consequences of lacking this abstraction, and *why* this abstraction is an effective solution given the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technologies.
    *   A concrete technical example of the problem (with code if appropriate, reflecting the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED language/framework).
    *   A real-world analogy, immediately and thoroughly mapped back to the technical domain, explaining how the problem manifests and is solved using the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technologies and patterns, including the *reasoning* for this mapping.

4.  **Dedicated Technical Sections for Major Aspects:**
    (Each major aspect of the abstraction should have its own H2/H3 heading. Each heading requires full CEM elaboration.) {cem_application_instruction}
    *   For each aspect: provide deep technical explanations of internal mechanisms; explain applied design patterns with DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED implementation details and justification; discuss technical trade-offs; describe boundary conditions, edge cases, error handling; explore DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED performance characteristics and scalability.

5.  **Code Examples:** {cem_application_instruction}
    *   Include ALL relevant, complete code examples. Annotate non-trivial lines, explaining *how* and *why* with DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED features.
    *   Highlight and explain DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED patterns, idioms, language/framework features, justifying choices.
    *   Note and explain DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED optimizations/performance considerations.
    *   Compare implementation approaches if applicable, evaluating design choices within the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED context.
    *   **Each code block must be immediately followed by a detailed analysis adhering to the CEM.**

6.  **Lists (Bulleted or Numbered):** {cem_application_instruction}
    *   **Every single list item is a topic for full, multi-paragraph CEM elaboration.** Do not treat items as brief entries.
    *   **Example of CEM-level depth for a list item (e.g., "Define entity relationships" in an ORM context):**
        *You would provide detailed paragraphs covering:* Why the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED ORM was chosen; how it defines relationships (e.g., decorators, annotations); the implications for data integrity and query efficiency (eager vs. lazy loading rationale); how DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED ORM features mitigate issues like N+1; the reasoning behind chosen cascade options; how the ORM translates these to database queries; and the trade-offs involved in this specific ORM-based approach compared to alternatives for this project. This explanation must be rich, specific to the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED tech, and many sentences long for each core aspect of that single list item.

7.  **Internal Implementation Details:**
    *   **Walkthrough:** Provide a non-code/code-light step-by-step walkthrough of the abstraction's operation, explaining DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED component participation and design flow. {cem_application_instruction}
    *   **Sequence Diagram:** Include a detailed Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` (5-8 participants) for a dummy example. Follow with a thorough explanation. {cem_application_instruction}
    *   **Deep Dive into Code (organized by subheadings, each adhering to CEM):** {cem_application_instruction}
        *   Initialization sequences & DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED DI/management strategies (explain benefits).
        *   Runtime behavior, control flow, algorithmic complexity (how DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED features support this, why algorithms chosen).
        *   Memory management in the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED context (lifecycles, caching, addressing leaks).
        *   Concurrency/threading using DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED patterns (how they manage it effectively).
        *   Error/exception propagation & handling in the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED stack (why strategy is robust).
        *   Performance optimizations implemented using DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED techniques (how they work, their impact).

8.  **Interactions with Other Abstractions:** {cem_application_instruction}
    *   Explicitly discuss interactions with EVERY related abstraction. Explain technically (data/control flow, dependencies) using DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED framework mechanisms, justifying *why* these interaction patterns were selected. Use Markdown links for other chapters{link_lang_note}.

9.  **Advanced Topics (each as a subheading with CEM elaboration):** {cem_application_instruction}
    *   Cover all aspects: core functionality, DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED initialization/configuration (with rationale), error handling/recovery (and resilience contribution), DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED performance characteristics/optimizations, integration patterns (with justification for choices), architectural patterns realized (and DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED advantages), known DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED limitations (and workarounds).

10. **Technical Best Practices Section:** {cem_application_instruction}
    (This heading and each sub-point below require full CEM elaboration.)
    *   Common pitfalls/anti-patterns in the DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED context (explaining why problematic).
    *   Optimized usage patterns for different scenarios (with technical reasoning for DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED tools, why optimal).
    *   Scaling considerations with DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED tech (how design accounts for it).
    *   Version-specific issues of DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED tools.

**GENERAL STYLE AND CONTENT MANDATES:**
-   Maintain a highly technical, authoritative, and precise writing style suitable for senior developers{tone_note}.
-   **"Thinking for Oneself" / Design Rationale:** This is integral to the CEM. For every significant technical point, explain not just the "what" and "how" but critically, the "why"â€”the design rationale, the reasons for choosing specific DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technologies or patterns, and potential alternatives.
-   **Analogies:** Use them to clarify complex DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED technical points, but always follow with a detailed mapping back to the specific technologies and rationale. The analogy explanation itself must adhere to the CEM.
-   **Conclusion:** Summarize key technical insights, design rationale, demonstrated CS principles/patterns (as implemented with DYNAMICALLY IDENTIFIED tools), and connections to the broader architecture. Transition to the next chapter with a Markdown link. {cem_application_instruction}
-   **EXCLUDE ALL TESTING-RELATED CONTENT.** Focus entirely on application logic for a LOSSLESS tutorial.
